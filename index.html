        <p>
            Virender Sehwag audio speaker iconpronunciation (born 20 October 1978) is a former Indian cricketer. Widely regarded as one of the most destructive batsmen of all time,
            Sehwag played as an aggressive right-handed opening batsman and also bowled part-time right-arm off-spin. He played his first One Day International in 1999 and joined the
            Indian test side in 2001.[2] In April 2009, Sehwag became the first Indian to be honoured as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for his performance in 2008,[3] 
            subsequently becoming the first player of any nationality to retain the award for 2009.[4] He is the former Occasional captain of India, former Vice-Captain of India,
            former captain of Delhi Daredevils and former captain of Delhi Ranji Team.
        </p>
        <h1> Early years</h1>
        <p>
            Sehwag was born in the Jat family[16] of a grain merchant.[17] He spent his childhood in a joint family with siblings, uncles, aunts and sixteen cousins. 
            Though now settled in New Delhi, the Sehwag family hails from Haryana. Sehwag was the third of four children born to father Krishan and mother Krishna Sehwag, with two 
            older sisters Manju and Anju, and younger brother Vinod. His father attributes his interest in cricket to a toy bat which he was given when he was seven months old. 
            He attended Arora Vidya School in Delhi, and pestered his parents to let him play cricket, on the basis that he was not academically gifted.[18] Early in his career 
            he had a reputation for being an attacking batsman and his coach was coach Amar Nath Sharma.
